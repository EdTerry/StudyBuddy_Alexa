StudyBuddy is a 'Skill' for Amazon Echo's Alexa to aide students with studying.

It does so by prompting the user to give it a question, followed by an answer.

Once the user has given all the questions and answers, Alexa will then repeat 
back a random question to which a user must then say the exact answer.
